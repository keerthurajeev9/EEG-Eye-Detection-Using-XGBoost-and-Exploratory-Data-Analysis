# EEG-Eye-Detection-Using-XGBoost-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting eye status (open or closed) using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We explore time-domain, frequency-space, and independent component analysis approaches, and build predictive models using XGBoost and Random Forest.
